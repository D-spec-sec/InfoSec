RPO refers to the maximum allowable amount of data loss that an organization can tolerate in the event of a disruption or disaster. It is measured in time and represents the point in time to which data must be recovered to resume normal operations. RPO is concerned with data loss, not the time it takes to recover.

RTO (Recovery Time Objective): RTO is the maximum acceptable time within which a system or service must be restored after a disruption or disaster. It measures the time it takes to recover a system to resume normal operations, not the amount of data that can be lost.

MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime): MTD refers to the maximum amount of time an organization can tolerate being without a particular system or service. While it is related to downtime, it does not specifically address the amount of data loss and is not measured in time. It focuses more on the overall duration during which a system can be unavailable.

AP (Availability Point): There is no standard concept known as "Availability Point" in the context of recovery objectives. Availability is a broader term related to the overall accessibility and usability of a system or service, but it does not specifically address the amount of data loss or the time it takes to recover.
