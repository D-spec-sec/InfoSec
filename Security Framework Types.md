## SABSA, 
Which stands for Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture, is a framework and methodology for developing risk-driven enterprise information security and cybersecurity architectures. It was created by David Lynas and is widely used to design and implement security solutions that align with business objectives. 
SABSA provides a holistic and structured approach to information security, focusing on integrating security into the overall business strategy.
Key features and components of SABSA include:

Business-Driven: SABSA is business-driven, emphasizing the alignment of security with business objectives. It encourages security practitioners to understand the business context, identify critical assets, and prioritize security measures based on business impact and risk.

Layers of Abstraction: SABSA uses layers of abstraction to break down complex security architectures into manageable components. These layers include the business context layer, the conceptual layer, the logical layer, the physical layer, and the component layer.

Risk-Based Approach: SABSA is a risk-driven methodology. It focuses on understanding and mitigating risks to the organization, ensuring that security measures are proportionate to the potential impact of security incidents on the business.

Lifecycle Approach: SABSA follows a lifecycle approach, encompassing strategy, design, implementation, and management. It supports ongoing adaptation and evolution of security architectures to address changing business requirements and emerging threats.

Frameworks and Models: SABSA integrates with various security frameworks, standards, and models, including ISO/IEC 27001, TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), and COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies).

Control Framework: SABSA provides a control framework that helps organizations define, design, and implement security controls in a consistent and comprehensive manner.


## FedRAMP
FedRAMP, or Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, is a U.S. government program specifically designed to standardize the security assessment, authorization, and monitoring of cloud products and services for federal agencies. While it is a crucial framework for cloud security, it is not a generic methodology for developing risk-driven enterprise information security architectures.

##COBIT: COBIT, or Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, is a framework developed by ISACA for IT governance and management. While COBIT addresses aspects of information security and risk management, it is not specifically focused on the comprehensive development of risk-driven enterprise information security architectures. It is more broadly applicable to IT governance and control.
