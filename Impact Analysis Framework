1. Introduction
Purpose: Define the objective of conducting an impact analysis, emphasizing its role in incident response and business continuity planning.
Scope and Applicability: Identify which incidents and assets the framework applies to, ensuring clarity and focus.

2. Identification of Assets
Inventory of Critical Assets: List all critical assets, including hardware, software, data, and human resources.
Data Classification: Categorize data based on sensitivity to determine the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Asset Dependencies: Map out dependencies between assets to understand cascading effects.

3. Incident Classification
Types of Incidents: Enumerate different incident types to facilitate specific impact assessments.
Severity Levels: Define severity levels to prioritize incidents based on their potential impact.

4. Impact Categories
Operational Impact: Assess how incidents affect business operations, including potential downtime and disruption.
Financial Impact: Calculate direct and indirect financial losses resulting from incidents.
Reputational Impact: Analyze the impact on the organization's reputation and customer trust.
Legal and Regulatory Impact: Evaluate potential legal consequences and regulatory compliance issues.
Data Integrity and Confidentiality Impact: Determine the effect on data integrity and confidentiality.

5. Impact Measurement Criteria
Operational Metrics: Use metrics such as downtime duration and the number of affected users to quantify operational impact.
Financial Metrics: Measure financial impact through incident response costs and revenue loss estimations.
Reputational Metrics: Track customer churn rates and analyze media coverage to gauge reputational impact.
Legal and Regulatory Metrics: Count compliance breaches and legal costs to assess legal impact.

6. Impact Analysis Process
Initial Assessment: Conduct a preliminary impact estimation based on incident description.
Detailed Impact Analysis: Perform an in-depth evaluation involving stakeholders, and use both quantitative and qualitative methods.
Impact Reporting: Create comprehensive reports with findings and mitigation recommendations.

7. Response and Mitigation Strategies
Immediate Response Actions: Identify and implement actions to mitigate immediate impacts.
Long-Term Mitigation Plans: Develop strategies to address long-term consequences and prevent recurrence.
Preventive Measures: Propose measures to reduce the likelihood of future incidents.

8. Post-Incident Review
Evaluation of Response Effectiveness: Review the effectiveness of the response actions.
Lessons Learned: Document insights gained to improve future incident response.
Update of Impact Analysis Framework: Revise the framework based on lessons learned.

9. Appendices
Impact Analysis Templates: Provide templates to standardize the impact analysis process.
Case Studies and Examples: Include real-world examples to illustrate the impact analysis process.
