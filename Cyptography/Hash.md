### SHA 256
is a secure hashing algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value. While it is widely used and considered secure for many applications, it is not as resistant to attacks as Argon2. SHA 256 is vulnerable to collision attacks and other cryptographic weaknesses, making it less secure compared to Argon2.

### MD5
is a widely used hashing algorithm, but it is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities that have been discovered over time. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, which can lead to data integrity issues and security breaches. It is not recommended for secure hashing applications, especially when compared to more modern and secure algorithms like Argon2.

### SHA 512
is a secure hashing algorithm, but it is not considered the most secure compared to Argon2. While SHA 512 produces a fixed-size output and is widely used for data integrity and security, it is vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as collision attacks, which can compromise its security in some scenarios.

### Argon2
is considered the most secure hashing technique due to its resistance to GPU-based attacks, side-channel attacks, and its ability to mitigate trade-off attacks. It is the current standard for password hashing and is designed to be memory-hard, making it difficult for attackers to parallelize their attacks efficiently.
