A Certificate Authority (CA) is an organization that plays a crucial role in the public key infrastructure (PKI). Its primary function is to verify the authenticity of a public key and bind it to the identity of an entity (individual, server, or organization). The CA issues digital certificates, which serve as a trusted confirmation of the association between the public key and the entity's identity.
