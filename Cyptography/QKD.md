QKD is considered the most secure key exchange technique for symmetric cryptography. It leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to secure the exchange of cryptographic keys. 
The fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, such as the observer effect, are utilized to detect any eavesdropping attempts during the key exchange process. 
QKD provides a high level of security by relying on the principles of quantum physics, making it resistant to certain types of attacks that classical cryptographic methods may be vulnerable to.
