### Cryptanalysis 
Cryptanalysisaims to compromise the security of a cryptographic system, and achieving this often involves discovering the keys involved, including the private key. Additionally, breaking the cryptographic algorithm is part of making the system ineffective, as it implies finding vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the algorithm itself. 






### Implementation
Implementation attacks focus on the construction and execution of the entire cryptosystem, rather than solely targeting the key or algorithm.

### A side-channel
A side-channel attack encompasses any form of attack that doesn't directly target the key or algorithm but instead exploits the inherent characteristics of the cryptosystem.

### Plaingext
In a plaintext attack, the attacker possesses not only the ciphertext but also the corresponding known plaintext.

### Timing
Timing attacks exploit flawed sequences of events occurring during sensitive operations.

### Ciphertext Only
Ciphertext Only attacks involve analyzing only the intercepted ciphertext without any knowledge of the corresponding plaintext or the key.

### Frequency Analysis
Frequency Analysis is a technique used in such attacks to exploit the patterns or frequencies of symbols in the ciphertext
