Digital signatures are typically created by first hashing the message to generate a fixed-size hash 

Hashing the message helps ensure its integrity by creating a fixed-size hash value unique to the message content.

Encrypting the hash with the user's private key provides authenticity, as only the corresponding public key can decrypt the signature. This process verifies that the message hasn't been tampered with and was signed by the owner of the private key.

Hashing ensures data integrity, and encrypting the hash with the private key provides authenticity and non-repudiation.
