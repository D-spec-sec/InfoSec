### Out of band
This refers to a key-exchange technique where the key exchange process occurs through a separate, secure communication channel. This could involve physically exchanging keys or using a different, secure network for key exchange.

### Asymmetric (Hybrid)
In asymmetric cryptography (public-key cryptography), a hybrid approach is often used for key exchange. In this technique, asymmetric cryptography is used to securely exchange a symmetric key, and then symmetric cryptography is used for the actual communication.

### Quantum
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a key-exchange technique that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics for secure key exchange. It leverages the properties of quantum systems to detect any eavesdropping attempts, providing a high level of security.
