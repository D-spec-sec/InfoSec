### TPM 
(Trusted Platform Module) is useful because it provides hardware-based security functions, such as encryption and authentication, which enhance the protection of sensitive data and improve overall system integrity.

### Storage Root Key 
(SRK): The Storage Root Key (SRK) is another key in the TPM, but it is not the key pair used during manufacturing. The SRK is used to protect other keys and is generated by the user during initialization.

### Attestation Identity Key 
(AIK): The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is used for attestation purposes and is not the key pair installed during manufacturing. It is typically generated by the TPM in response to a specific attestation request.

### The Endorsement Key 
(EK) is a unique key burned into the TPM during manufacturing and is used to endorse the TPM. The public/private key pair is stored in the TPM's persistent memory along with the EK for secure encryption and authentication processes.

### The Public Key 
is part of the public/private key pair, but in the TPM's persistent memory, both the public and private keys are stored together as a pair. The public key alone is not stored in the TPM's persistent memory.
