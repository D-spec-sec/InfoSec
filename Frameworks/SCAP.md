 ### Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)

The key elements of SCAP that directly pertain to vulnerability assessment are as follows:

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): Offers a structured naming scheme for identifying security vulnerabilities.

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): Presents a standardized method for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities.

Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE): Establishes a naming convention for system configuration issues.

Common Platform Enumeration (CPE): Introduces a naming system for categorizing operating systems, applications, and devices.

Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF): Provides a language for defining security checklists.

Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL): provides a language for describing security testing procedures.
