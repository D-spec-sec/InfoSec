SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers and service providers, enabling single sign-on (SSO) across different systems or domains.


SAML 2.0, the three essential components are:

Principal: The entity (user or system) for whom authentication is performed.

Identity Provider (IdP): The system responsible for authenticating the user and providing identity information.

Service Provider (SP): The system that hosts and provides the service, relying on the identity information from the Identity Provider.
