### Preaction
In a Preaction system, water is held back by a valve until a fire detection system signals the need for suppression. Once a heat-activated sprinkler head is triggered, the valve opens, allowing water to flow into the pipes and be dispensed.

### Wet pipe
In a wet pipe system, water is constantly present in the pipes, ready to be discharged immediately when a sprinkler head is activated. This does not align with the described system.

### Dry pipe
In a dry pipe system, pipes are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, and water is held back until a sprinkler head is activated, allowing the release of the pressurized gas and subsequent water flow. This differs from the system described.

### Hot pipe
"Hot pipe" is not a standard term used to describe a fire suppression system. It does not correspond to the described system where pipes are filled only when fire is detected.
