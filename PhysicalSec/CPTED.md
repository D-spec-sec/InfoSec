Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a theory that emphasizes designing physical spaces and environments to prevent crime and discourage malicious acts. It recognizes that the layout, architecture, and design of an environment can influence human behavior, and strategic design can contribute to reducing opportunities for criminal activities.


The four primary areas of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED). These areas are:

Natural Access Control: This involves design features that guide people along desired paths and discourage them from entering restricted areas. Examples include fences, gates, and landscaping.

Natural Surveillance: This focuses on increasing the visibility of a space to enable natural surveillance by both residents and passersby. Clear sightlines and unobstructed views help deter criminal activities.

Territorial Reinforcement: This involves creating a sense of ownership and territoriality to make individuals feel responsible for specific spaces. It includes the use of landscaping, signage, and architectural elements to define and strengthen boundaries.

Maintenance: Regular maintenance of the environment is essential for creating a positive and cared-for atmosphere. Neglected or deteriorating spaces can attract criminal activities, so a well-maintained environment contributes to crime prevention.
