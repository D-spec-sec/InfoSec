FedRAMP, which stands for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, is a U.S. government program that standardizes the security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring processes for cloud products and services. FedRAMP is designed to ensure that cloud service providers (CSPs) adhere to a set of rigorous security standards when offering their services to federal agencies.

Key features of FedRAMP include:

### Standardized Security Requirements: 
FedRAMP establishes a set of standardized security requirements that cloud service providers must meet. These requirements cover various aspects of security, including data protection, access controls, incident response, and continuous monitoring.

### Authorization Process: 
Cloud service providers seeking to offer services to federal agencies must go through a rigorous authorization process. This process involves a thorough security assessment conducted by a third-party assessment organization (3PAO). Once authorized, the CSP receives a FedRAMP Authorization to Operate (ATO).

### Reuse of Security Assessments: 
FedRAMP encourages the reuse of security assessments, allowing agencies to leverage the work done by others. This helps streamline the authorization process and reduce duplication of effort.

### Continuous Monitoring: 
After receiving authorization, CSPs are required to continuously monitor and report on their security posture. This ongoing monitoring helps ensure that the cloud services maintain the required security standards over time.

### Joint Authorization Board (JAB): 
The FedRAMP program includes a Joint Authorization Board, consisting of representatives from several federal agencies. The JAB can grant provisional authorizations for cloud services, and agencies can leverage these authorizations when making their own risk-based decisions.
