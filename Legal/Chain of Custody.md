### Identify
Develop an organizational understanding to manage physical and cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and
capabilities.
 Identify critical assets within the organization.1
 Inventory all systems, devices, software, data, and people.
 Catalog external systems, especially dependent systems and/or processes that the organizations critical assets may
integrate with, especially if those systems or processes are outside the control of the organization.
 Document the digital and analog forms or logs that track transactions and access.
 Routinely assess the logs and forms to understand if there are any gaps in transactions or access that could lead to a
break in chain of custody.
 Evaluate your preservation rules to determine if they meet the organization’s business needs.

### Protect
Develop and implement a chain of custody plan and appropriate safeguards to ensure critical services, systems, and data
are properly secured while at rest and in transit. Protective measures keep unauthorized and malicious actors out.
 Implement access control, both physically and electronically, to assets and facilities.
 Ensure that individuals are only authorized to access systems, data, and facilities that are pertinent to their job
functions—use the Principle of Least Privilege.
 Ensure network integrity is protected and remote access is managed.
 Implement continuous monitoring of transactions, activities and access control processes.
 Manage information and records consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of information.

### Detect
Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a chain-of-custody breach. Detective measures
provide evidence that a breach has occurred.
 Log all transactions electronically (ex. Audit or event logs) or physically through chain of custody documents.
 Track each asset independently by uniquely identifying each asset, such as tamper-evidence or serialization.
 Establish incident alert thresholds.
 Guarantee continuous monitoring and/or alerting of detective measures. If the chain of custody breaks without
having established monitoring measures, an incident can go undetected.

### Respond
Develop appropriate activities to implement in response to a detected breach of the chain of custody. Response
measures allow the organization to determine the impact and consequences of the breach.
 Establish processes to receive, analyze, and respond to a breach, loss of integrity, or preservation to the chain of
custody records.
 Investigate notifications from detection systems.
 Determine if the impact of breach leads to a reportable incident.
 Report incidents consistent with established criteria.
 Ensure personnel know their roles and order of operations when a response is required.
 Provide strict oversight of forensic activities being performed, including validating personnel, to ensure the chain of
custody and integrity of the systems, data, and any evidence collected.

### Recover
Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any critical services, systems,
or data that were impaired due to the chain-of-custody breach or cybersecurity incident.
 Execute recovery processes and procedures to ensure the restoration of systems or assets affected by the incident.
 Sanitize media in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1.
 Review and assess hardware to determine whether system components have been replaced or modified in any way.
 Restore systems using a validated version of the firmware and software (e.g., trusted build).
 In cases where critical infrastructure systems are required to undergo certification, the accredited certifying body may
need to review the affected systems for recertification.
 If systems or data must be turned over to a validated entity, processes should be in place for reassuming and
validating the chain of custody prior to reintegrating those systems or data into your infrastructure. These processes
should potentially include media sanitization, trusted build installation, system recertification, acceptance testing
protocols, etc.
 There may be situations where it is not possible to re-establish the chain of custody or integrity of the systems or data
(i.e., loss of the chain of custody). In those instances, consider decommissioning and replacing assets of concern.
There may be situations where the time, cost, and/or expertise to recover, re-establish the chain of custody, and
potentially recertify systems is not practical.  A recovery plan should include procedures for how to handle such a
scenario, including the complete replacement of the assets.
