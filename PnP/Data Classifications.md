The lowest classification level must be "Public" is the less accurate statement because the classification system does not universally mandate that the lowest level must be "Public." Data classification is context-dependent, and different organizations may use various classification schemes. In some cases, the lowest classification level might be unclassified or have a specific designation other than "Public."

Also backed up data must be classified: This statement is generally accurate. Backed-up data should retain its original classification to ensure proper security measures are applied. It helps maintain consistency in handling sensitive information.

Every classification level must have its destruction requirements: This statement is accurate. Different levels of classified data may have distinct handling and destruction requirements to ensure appropriate security measures are applied throughout the information lifecycle.

Both hardware and software should be classified: This statement is generally accurate. Organizations may classify both hardware and software to manage and safeguard their information assets effectively. Classification helps define access controls, usage policies, and security measures for these assets.
