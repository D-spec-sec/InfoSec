### Change Register
A Change Request will always have a Change Register log to track and document all requested changes, including details such as the nature of the change, the reason for the change, the impact assessment, and the approval status. 
This log helps in maintaining a record of all changes for audit and accountability purposes.


### Configuration Management Plan
Configuration Management Plan (CMP) is a document that outlines the procedures, processes, and responsibilities for establishing and maintaining consistent configurations of products, systems, or software throughout their lifecycle.

The plan provides a structured approach to configuration management, ensuring that changes are properly controlled, documented, and tracked. It typically includes details on configuration identification, baselines, change control processes, version control, and the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the configuration management process.

The goal of a Configuration Management Plan is to ensure that the configuration of items is well-managed, allowing for effective control and traceability throughout the development and maintenance phases.
