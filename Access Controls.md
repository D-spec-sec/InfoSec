Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of restricting system access to authorized users based on their roles (or positions, or functions) within an organization.

In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to these roles. This approach simplifies the management of permissions by grouping users with similar job responsibilities under predefined roles.
Users acquire the permissions associated with their roles, streamlining the process of granting, modifying, or revoking access rights. RBAC enhances security, scalability, and ease of administration in systems with varying levels of access and numerous users.

Role-based access control is usually administered through various approaches:

1. In the Non-RBAC method, users are directly associated with applications without any involvement of roles.

2. The Limited RBAC approach involves users being linked to multiple roles and directly associated with applications lacking role-based access features.

3. In the Hybrid RBAC model, users are associated with roles spanning multiple applications, with specific rights assigned selectively to those roles.

4. The Full RBAC method involves users being linked to enterprise roles, encompassing comprehensive access rights.

Unless specified otherwise, RBAC denotes Full RBAC.

Rule-based access control (RBAC) is a security model where access decisions are based on predefined rules or policies. These rules typically specify which users or roles are allowed to access specific resources or perform certain actions.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC), on the other hand, is a security model where access decisions are based on attributes associated with users, resources, and the environment. 
These attributes can include user characteristics (such as role, department, or clearance level), resource properties (such as sensitivity or classification), and contextual factors (such as time of access or location). ABAC evaluates these attributes against policies to determine access permissions dynamically.
