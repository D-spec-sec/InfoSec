Data sovereignty laws pertain to regulations that mandate entities handling certain types of data to comply with the respective country's laws, irrespective of the data's physical location.
These laws emphasize that even if the data is processed or stored outside the country, it must still adhere to the regulations of the country where the data subject resides.

Data localization laws refer to regulations requiring specific types of data to be stored and processed exclusively within the borders of a particular country. This means that the data must not leave the country's geographical boundaries.
