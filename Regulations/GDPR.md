According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data controller is the entity that determines the purposes, conditions, and means of processing personal data. The controller is primarily responsible for complying with GDPR requirements and ensuring the protection of individuals' data.

The processor: While data processors have obligations under GDPR, such as processing data only on the controller's instructions and implementing appropriate security measures, the primary responsibility for compliance and safeguarding data lies with the data controller.

The authority: This is not accurate. The term "authority" is vague in the context of GDPR. GDPR establishes supervisory authorities in each EU member state, but their role is regulatory oversight rather than direct responsibility for individual data protection.

The auditor: Auditors may play a role in assessing and ensuring GDPR compliance, but they are not the primary accountable entity. The responsibility for safeguarding individuals' data lies with the data controller.

The focus of GDPR is on the rights of individuals concerning their own personal data, the rights under GDPR:

Right to erasure: This is a subject right according to GDPR, often referred to as the "right to be forgotten." Individuals have the right to request the erasure of their personal data under certain conditions.

Right to be informed about how data is processed: This is a subject right according to GDPR. Individuals have the right to be informed about the processing of their personal data, including details about the purposes of processing, the categories of data involved, and the recipients of the data.

Know what of his/her data the Controller is processing: This is also a subject right according to GDPR. Individuals have the right to know what personal data a controller is processing about them. This right is related to the transparency principle of GDPR, which emphasizes informing individuals about the processing of their data.
