### The initial step in the identity proofing procedure is to uniquely identify the individual within a specific population or context. This step helps ensure that the individual's identity is accurately established before granting access to sensitive information or systems.

NIST SP 800-63A provides good guidance to the identity proofing procedure. Look at step 1: Resolution.

“Resolution” is the first step in the identity proofing process. The goal of this step is to resolve a claimed identity to a single, unique identity within the context of the population of users served by the CSP (Credential Service Provider).

During this step, information about the applicant’s claimed identity is collected in the form of identity evidence and personally identifiable information (PII). This information is used to establish a unique representation of the individual’s identity for use during the proofing process and enrollment.

The types of identity attributes that may be retrieved from identity documents and used for identity resolution typically include, but are not limited to: name (first, last, middle) with combinations and variations, address (number, street, state, zip code) with combinations and variations, birth date (day, month, year) with combinations and variations, email address, and phone number.

Note that the goal of identity resolution is to uniquely distinguish an individual within a given population or context. Effective identity resolution uses the minimum set of attributes necessary to resolve to a unique individual.
