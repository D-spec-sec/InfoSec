Diameter is an open protocol designed to enhance the capabilities of RADIUS and TACACS+, addressing certain limitations, especially concerning mobile clients. RADIUS, relying on UDP, faces challenges in effectively handling remote access, IP mobility, and policy control.

TACACS+, widely used in network devices, particularly in Cisco environments is often preferred for device administration purposes and may not be as commonly used for broader AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) scenarios.
