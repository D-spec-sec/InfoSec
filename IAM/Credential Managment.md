### Self-Service Password Reset
Self-Service Password Reset is a common feature of credential management systems. It allows users to reset their passwords without the need for direct IT intervention, improving efficiency and user experience.

### Password Storage
Credential management systems do involve secure password storage. They store and manage user credentials securely to ensure that sensitive information is protected. This is an integral part of a credential management system.

### Password Synchronization Across Multiple Systems
Credential management systems often include password synchronization capabilities. This feature ensures that a user's password changes are synchronized across various systems, enhancing consistency and security.

Identity verification is typically not part of a credential management system. Identity verification is usually handled by authentication processes outside the scope of credential management, such as multi-factor authentication or biometric systems.
