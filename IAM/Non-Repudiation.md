The principle of non-repudiation is typically applied during the Accountability step of Access Control. Non-repudiation ensures that a user cannot deny their actions or transactions, providing evidence that the user performed a particular action. Accountability involves logging and tracking user activities, and non-repudiation measures help in attributing actions to specific users in a way that cannot be denied.
