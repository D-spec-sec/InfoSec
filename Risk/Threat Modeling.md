### STRIDE
is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft. It stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It is designed to help identify and mitigate security threats in both logical (software) and physical systems.

### PASTA 
A (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is another threat modeling framework, but it was not developed by Microsoft. It is a risk-centric methodology that focuses on understanding the attacker's perspective and simulating attacks.

### OCTAVE 
A (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) is a risk assessment and management framework, but it is not specifically a threat modeling technique. It focuses on identifying and managing risks to organizational assets.
