In the process of risk ranking, quantitative analysis involves determining the anticipated annual cost of risk to the organization, known as the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE). This can be computed using the formula:

ALE = SLE (AV x EF) x ARO

ALE = (AV x EF) x ARO

Here, the acronyms correspond to:

AV: Asset Value - The estimated financial worth or value of an asset within an organization.

EF: Exposure Factor - The percentage of asset value likely to be lost in the event of a security breach.

SLE: Single Loss Expectancy - The anticipated monetary loss from a single occurrence of a security incident.

ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurrence - The estimated frequency or likelihood of a security incident occurring within a year.

ALE: Annualized Loss Expectancy - The projected annual financial impact resulting from potential security incidents, calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO.
