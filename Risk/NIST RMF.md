The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) consists of seven steps designed to help organizations manage and mitigate risks effectively. Here is a brief overview of each step:

### 1. Prepare:

Establish the context and priorities for the risk management process.

Define the scope, boundaries, and priorities of the system.

Develop an organizational risk management strategy.

### 2. Categorize:

Identify and classify information systems and the information processed based on impact levels.

Determine the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### 3. Select:

Choose appropriate security controls based on the system categorization.

Use guidance provided in NIST Special Publication 800-53 to select relevant controls.

### 4. Implement:

Put the selected security controls into practice.

Develop and implement security plans.

Integrate security controls into the system development life cycle.

### 5. Assess:

Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.

Conduct security assessments and testing to ensure controls are functioning as intended.

Analyze the results to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### 6. Authorize:

Based on the assessment results, the authorizing official makes a risk-based decision to grant or deny system authorization.

Document the decision in an Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter.

### 7. Monitor:

Continuously monitor security controls and the security state of the system.

Report security status to appropriate stakeholders.

Update the risk management process based on changes to the system, threats, or vulnerabilities.
