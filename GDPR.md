According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data controller is the entity that determines the purposes, conditions, and means of processing personal data. The controller is primarily responsible for complying with GDPR requirements and ensuring the protection of individuals' data.

Incorrect Options:

The processor: While data processors have obligations under GDPR, such as processing data only on the controller's instructions and implementing appropriate security measures, the primary responsibility for compliance and safeguarding data lies with the data controller.

The authority: This is not accurate. The term "authority" is vague in the context of GDPR. GDPR establishes supervisory authorities in each EU member state, but their role is regulatory oversight rather than direct responsibility for individual data protection.

The auditor: Auditors may play a role in assessing and ensuring GDPR compliance, but they are not the primary accountable entity. The responsibility for safeguarding individuals' data lies with the data controller.
