### Updates
The training for your staff must necessarily include updates to ensure that the information is current and relevant. Regular updates help employees stay informed about changes, advancements, or new regulations in their field.

### Appendixes 
While appendices can be useful for additional reference material, they are not a mandatory component for all types of training. The necessity of appendixes depends on the nature and complexity of the training content.

### Final tests
While final tests can be beneficial for assessing the effectiveness of the training, they are not an absolute necessity for all types of training programs. (This is the 2nd best answer !)

### Legal approval
While legal compliance is crucial, not all training programs necessarily require explicit legal approval. The need for legal approval depends on the industry, content, and regulatory requirements associated with the training material.
