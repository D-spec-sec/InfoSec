The principle of "Least Privilege" is a security concept that suggests individuals should be given the minimum level of access or permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
Granting a new employee access to all folders right after employment might not align with the principle of least privilege.
This action provides more access than necessary for the employee's initial role, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental misuse of sensitive information.



The concept of "need-to-know" in security is closely linked to the principle of least privilege.
While the principle of least privilege entails users being granted only the essential abilities required to interact with system and information objects, "need-to-know" emphasizes that users should not have access to information or systems unless it is necessary for their job, irrespective of their assigned abilities.
