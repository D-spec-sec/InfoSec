### Policies
Policies are high-level directives that guide decision-making and actions within an organization. They are typically formulated at a higher level, often by top management or executives, and may not involve as much collaboration with line personnel.

### Procedures
Procedures are detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to perform specific tasks or activities. They are often created by middle management in consultation with line personnel because they involve the practical aspects of carrying out organizational processes. Once developed, these procedures may be approved by senior managers to ensure alignment with overall organizational goals.

### Standards
Standards are benchmarks or criteria used to assess and measure performance or quality. While they may be set with input from various levels, they are not typically authored by middle management in collaboration with line personnel.

### Frameworks
Frameworks are overarching structures that provide a foundation for the development and implementation of various processes, policies, and procedures. They are usually established at a higher level and are not commonly written collaboratively by middle management and line personnel.
