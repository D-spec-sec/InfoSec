The principle of "trust but verify" underscores that relying solely on Preventive Controls is insufficient to guarantee security. Preventive controls are measures designed to prevent security incidents, but they may not catch every possible threat. The principle suggests that additional verification through detective controls and monitoring is necessary for a more comprehensive security posture.

Can be accomplished using Preventive Controls: 

Preventive controls aim to prevent security incidents from occurring by implementing measures such as access controls, encryption, and authentication. While important, relying solely on preventive controls without verification mechanisms can lead to a false sense of security. The principle of "trust but verify" highlights the importance of validating the effectiveness of these controls through monitoring and testing.
