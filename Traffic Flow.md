North-South Traffic:

Definition: North-south traffic refers to the communication flow between the internal components of an organization's network and external entities, typically going in and out of the organization's boundaries.

Example: When a user within the organization accesses a website on the internet, the data flow from the user's device to the external web server represents north-south traffic. Similarly, when an external service sends data into the organization's network, it is also considered north-south traffic.



East-West Traffic:

Definition: East-west traffic involves communication between devices and services within the organization's internal network. It signifies the lateral flow of data between servers, devices, or applications that are hosted within the same data center or network segment.

Example: When two servers in the same data center communicate with each other, sharing data or resources, it is considered east-west traffic. Interactions between different components of an application, database, or storage system within the organization fall under the category of east-west traffic.
