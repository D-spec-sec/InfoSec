These two elements (Author, Date of Creation) constitute system metadata because they pertain to the technical aspects and characteristics of the data. They are typically automatically generated and managed by the computer system or software handling the data.

In general terms, you should know the following about metadata.

Metadata, commonly known as "data about data," refers to information that describes one or more aspects of a dataset, aiding in its organization and utilization. 
It encompasses details such as the data's creation method, purpose, timestamp, creator, location, standards, file size, quality, source, and creation process. 
For instance, a digital image's metadata may include attributes like its dimensions, color depth, resolution, creation date, and camera settings, while a text document's metadata could comprise details such as its length, authorship, creation date, and a brief summary.
Metadata embedded within web pages also offers descriptions of content and keyword tags, though their significance in search engine ranking declined in the late 1990s due to "keyword stuffing," a practice exploiting metatags to falsely elevate search relevance.
