The 3-2-1 rule recommends maintaining three copies of your data, with two copies stored on different types of media (e.g., hard drive, cloud storage) and one copy stored offsite. This strategy provides redundancy, protection against hardware failures, and safeguards against events like natural disasters or theft.


 The value of the data stored on the HDDs helps in assessing the importance of the storage devices and the level of security and features required.
